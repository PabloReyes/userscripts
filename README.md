Description
====
Personal collection of userscripts ready to be used on GreaseMonkey, TamperMonkey or other userscripts manager.

* [WebWhatsapp Hide Preview](/webwhatsapp_hide_previews): Hide image and video previews on the web version of Whatsapp. Avoid sneaky colleagues looking at your personal pics.


Installation
===
These userscripts are valid for mostly any new browser. I would recommend installing a userscript manager like 
*[tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)* for Chrome or *[greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)* for Firefox.

Just go to any of the userscript projects up here, click on the .js file and then click on "raw". Your manager should handle the rest and ask you if you want to install it.

Depending on the browser, it may have built-in support for userscripts. In the case of Chrome, you can just drag & drop the js file into the "Extensions" screen and it will ask if you want to install it.
