Personal collection of userscripts ready to be used on GreasMonkey, TamperMonkey or other userscripts manager

## webwhatsapp_hide_previews.user.js
When using the new web version of whatsapp, the image previews are quite big and can lead to private pictures/videos being seen by others. 
With this script, the previews will be almost invisible, and you'll need to manually click on it to view the original image/video.

If you try hard enough, you'll be able to see some shapes in the image, which will help you decide if you should open it or not.

Installation
===
These userscripts are valid for mostly any new browser. I would recommend installing a userscript manager like 
*[tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)* for Chrome or *[greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)* for Firefox

Then just click in any of the .js files and your manager should handle the rest and ask you if you want to install it.

Depending on the browser, it may have built-in support for userscripts. In the case of Chrome, you can just drag & drop the js file into the "Extensions" screen and it will ask if you want to install it.
